                    The sampling of spatial and temporal visual information for all living organisms is finite. 
                    The accuracy and speed of visual systems contributes in part to an animal's 
                    sensitivity to visual motion. The ability to see swift motions is a crucial adaptation among 
                    bird species, which are high-speed animals that navigate in a three-dimensional world. Until 
                    recently, our understanding in how animals utilise their vision in flight have been limited to 
                    invertebrates models only. Hummingbirds have become the ideal model species to bridge our understanding
                    of visual guidance between invertebrates and vertebrates as they are vertebrates that has the unique
                    capacity to sustain hover, which is a hallmark feature of most volant invertebrates.

                    At the time of my Master's of Science degree with the <a href="https://altshuler.zoology.ubc.ca/">Altshuler lab</a>, 
                    hummingbirds' sensitivity to visual information, both spatially and temporally, remained unknown. 
                    Using operant conditioning and optocollic reflex experiments, I identified the temporal and spatial 
                    acuity thresholds of the Anna's hummingbird's visual system for my 
                    <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0166301">MSc thesis</a>. 
                    These data along with histological examination of hummingbird retinas were published in 
                    <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/705124">Physiological and Biochemical Zoology</a>, 
                    marking the first time both spatial and temporal acuity was measured in a sustained hovering animal.

                    Birds can steer a precise course at high speed, but little is known about how they avoid collisions 
                    with surrounding objects and the ground. We manipulated the visual environment of hummingbirds as they 
                    flew across a long chamber to evaluate how they use visual information for course control. We found 
                    that lateral course control is based on the vertical size of features, rather than the strategy observed 
                    in insects of regulating foreâ€“aft image velocity. However, like insects, birds use image velocity in 
                    the vertical axis for altitude control. Our results suggest that in natural settings, birds may avoid 
                    collisions by monitoring the vertical size, expansion, and relative position of obstacles.
